# Balanced-flight-cancellation-and-delay---2019-2023

The dataset is sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, covering Airline Flight Delay and Cancellation Data from August 2019 to August 2023. The dataset is accessible on Kaggle
The primary goal of selecting this dataset is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Flight Delay and Cancellation Metrics from 2019 to 2023.

## Key Variables:

The dataset encompasses crucial variables, including flight routes (origin, destination), time ranges for events (minutes, local time), and limited information on delay and cancellation reasons/attributions. There are 35 columns in total, containing details such as airport code, latitude, longitude, airline information, flight numbers, departure and arrival times, delays, cancellations, and more.

## Objectives
 Analyzing  Departure Delays, Arrival Delays, and Cancellation Rates
  Reason for delays
  Time Analysis
  Distance and route Analysis
  
## Key Questions: 
路   What is the overall frequency of flight delays and cancellations in the dataset? 
路   Are there specific time periods, airlines, or routes with higher rates of delays or cancellations? 
.   How does the time of day, airline, or distance impact delays
路   Are there specific airlines consistently facing higher delays or cancellations? 
路  Is there a correlation between the distance of the flight and the likelihood of delays?
